# planet-sim

Planet simulator library based on
[PLASIM](https://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/en/arbeitsgruppen/theoretische-meteorologie/modelle/plasim.html),
a fortran climate model of intermediate complexity.

If completed, modern Rust implementation would likely be slower, but could
perhaps offer a greater degree of flexibility than the original fortran version.
